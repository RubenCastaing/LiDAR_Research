# LiDAR_Research
This repository holds a website for visualising LiDAR data. This is read and hosted by Render.

There are also Python files for data processing. These take Lidar data in polar coordinates and convert them into cartesian coordinates. It converts nc files into a python data frame for easy processing.

There are also 3d models and different forms of LiDAR data. Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear. :)
